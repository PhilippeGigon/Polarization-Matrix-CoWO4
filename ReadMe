This code allows to compute the polarization matrix 
elements for CoWO4 with the assumed magnetic structure
and to compare them to experimental data from 
spherical neutron polarimetry. The experimental data
can be found in the file CoWO4_SNP_data.txt

The file constants.py contains all the physical parameters
for the unit cell and the plot.
A unit cell is parametrized by its sidelength in ANGSTROEM
and the angle beta between the two sides A and C (monoclinic).

The computations are done in main.py. First, the atoms 
(AtomGenerator.Atom) are initialized at their positions. 
Then they are used to construct the unit magnetic unit cell 
(UnitCell.Unit_cell). Finally, the polarization matrix elements 
are computed (P_matrix.get_P) and ploted together 
with the measured values.

Details about the polarization matrix can be found in:
